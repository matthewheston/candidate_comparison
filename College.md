|  Ensure no student has to borrow to pay for tuition, books, or fees to attend a four-year public college in their state.   Enable Americans with existing student loan debt to refinance at current rates. Hold colleges and universities accountable for controlling costs and making tuition affordable.  Students should never have to borrow to pay for tuition, books, and fees to attend a four-year public college in their state under the New College Compact. Pell Grants are not included in the calculation of no-debt-tuition, so Pell recipients will be able to use their grants fully for living expenses. Students at community college will receive free tuition.   Students will do their part by contributing their earnings from working 10 hours a week.  Families will do their part by making an affordable and realistic family contribution.  The federal government will make a major investment in the New College Compact by providing grants to states that commit to these goals, and by cutting interest rates on loans.  States will have to step up and meet their obligation to invest in higher education by maintaining current levels of higher education funding and reinvesting over time.  Colleges and universities will be accountable for improving outcomes and controlling costs to ensure that tuition is affordable and that students who invest in college leave with a degree.  We will encourage innovators who design imaginative new ways of providing a valuable college education to students—while cracking down on abusive practices that burden students with debt without value.  A $25 billion fund will support HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs serving a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients to help lower the cost of attendance and improve student outcomes at low-cost, modest-endowment nonprofit private schools.   Under Hillary’s plan, if you have student debt, you will be able to refinance your loans at current rates. An estimated 25 million borrowers will receive debt relief, and the typical borrower could save $2,000 over the life of his or her loans.  For future undergraduates, the plan will significantly cut interest rates so they reflect the government’s low cost of debt. This could save students hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of their loans.  Everyone will be able to enroll in a simplified, income-based repayment program so that borrowers never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make. | MAKE TUITION FREE AT PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. STOP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM MAKING A PROFIT ON STUDENT LOANS. SUBSTANTIALLY CUT STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES. ALLOW AMERICANS TO REFINANCE STUDENT LOANS AT TODAY’S LOW INTEREST RATES. ALLOW STUDENTS TO USE NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID AND WORK STUDY PROGRAMS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE. FULLY PAID FOR BY IMPOSING A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATORS. |
