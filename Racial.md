Here's bullet points extracted on this issue from each candidate:

| Hillary | Bernie |
| ------  | -----  |
| <ul><li> End the era of mass incarceration.</li><li> Protect immigrants’ rights and keep families together.</li><li>Defend every American’s right to vote.</li><li>Dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. In too many communities, student discipline is overly harsh, with too large an emphasis on suspension, expulsion, or even police involvement—disproportionately impacting students of color and those with the greatest economic, social, and academic needs. Hillary will work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by providing $2 billion in support to schools to reform overly punitive disciplinary policies, calling on states to reform school disturbance laws, and encouraging states to use federal education funding to implement social and emotional support interventions.</li><li>End the era of mass incarceration. America’s criminal justice system is out of balance. Keeping nonviolent offenders behind bars does little to reduce crime, but it does a lot to tear apart families and communities. One in every 28 children now has a parent in prison, 1.5 million African American men are missing from their communities, and Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average. Hillary will work to cut mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses in half, apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively, and eliminate the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine. She will prioritize treatment and rehabilitation—rather than incarceration—for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders. And she will end the privatization of our prisons.</li><li>Strengthen bonds of trust between communities and police. African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men found guilty of the same offenses. From Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable. Black lives matter. Everyone in this country should stand firmly behind that. Hillary believes that effective policing and constitutional policing go hand-in-hand—we can and must do both. As president, Hillary will invest in law enforcement training programs on issues such as implicit bias, use of force, and de-escalation. She will also create national guidelines for use of force, provide federal matching funds to make body cameras available to every police department in America, and support legislation to ban racial profiling by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials.</li><li>Protect the right to vote. Hillary has laid out her vision to help more Americans exercise their right to vote and defend against the systematic, deliberate efforts to stop millions from participating in our democracy. As president, she will fight to repair the Voting Rights Act and implement universal, automatic voter registration so that every American will be registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they opt out.  </li><li>Protect immigrants’ rights and keep families together. America’s immigrants continue to earn lower wages, lag behind in education achievement, and face discrimination in their lives. And millions of undocumented immigrants—the majority Latino and AAPI—live in constant fear that deportation will tear their families apart. Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform, including a full and equal pathway to citizenship. She will conduct humane, targeted enforcement, including by ending family detention and closing private immigrant detention centers. </li><li>End the epidemic of gun violence in our communities. Gun violence is the leading cause of death for young African American men—more than the next nine leading causes combined. Hillary believes we must do more to crack down on gun stores that flood our communities with illegal guns and deprive our children of their futures. That is why she will stand up to the gun lobby and work to build on President Obama’s common sense reforms. </li><li>Fight environmental injustice. Clean air and clean water are basic human rights—they shouldn’t vary between ZIP codes. Yet, too many children in low-income housing are exposed to lead, African American children are twice as likely to suffer from asthma as white children, half of Latinos live in areas where the air quality does not meet EPA's health standards—and climate change will put vulnerable populations at even greater risk. As president, Hillary will make environmental justice a priority by working to reduce air pollution, investing in the removal of toxins like lead, developing greener and more resilient infrastructure, tackling energy poverty, and boosting efforts to clean up highly polluted toxic sites. </li><li>Close the education achievement gap.  Every child—in every ZIP code—deserves the opportunity to live up to his or her potential. That begins with a world class education from birth through college. Hillary will double America’s investment in Early Head Start and ensure that every four year old in America has access to high-quality preschool to begin closing the achievement gap. She will modernize and elevate the teaching profession to drive student achievement in our K-12 schools. And her college plan will make college affordable and relieve the crushing burden of student debt.</li><li>End violence against the transgender community—particularly women of color. LGBT Americans, particularly transgender women of color, are disproportionately the targets of discrimination, harassment, and violence. As president, Hillary will fight for full LGBT equality. She will will work to protect transgender individuals from violence by improving the reporting of hate crimes, investing in law enforcement training that promotes fair and impartial interactions with the LGBT community, and directing the government to collect better data regarding crime victims.</li><li>Revitalize the economy in communities being left out and left behind. It’s unacceptable that so many African American families live in pockets of extreme poverty and that so many African American youths are unable to secure a good job. Hillary’s Economic Revitalization Initiative will invest $125 billion to create good-paying jobs, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and connect housing to opportunity in communities that have been neglected for too long: </li><li>$50 billion to create millions of new jobs and provide pathways of opportunity. As president, Hillary will work to create jobs in communities that are being left out. Her plan includes $20 billion to create youth jobs, particularly for African American, Native American, and Latino youth; $5 billion to create reentry programs that will help formerly incarcerated Americans get back on their feet when they return to society; and $25 billion to support entrepreneurship and small business growth in underserved communities.  </li><li>$50 billion in infrastructure investments to connect working families to good-paying jobs and opportunity. Too many Americans are trapped in so-called “opportunity deserts,” where a lack of reliable transportation keeps them from accessing good-paying jobs. As president, Hillary will make significant investments in public transit to connect the unemployed and underemployed to jobs they need. She will also rebuild crumbling water systems to preserve public health and create jobs and opportunity for local residents and small businesses.  </li><li>$25 billion to remove blight from neighborhoods, remove barriers to sustainable homeownership, and connect affordable housing to economic opportunity. Centuries of housing discrimination have excluded people of color from the mainstream mortgage market and cut families off from communities with high-performing schools, safe streets, and good-paying jobs. Hillary will fight to ensure that housing policy and the housing market serve to connect every family to economic opportunity, rather than exclude them. And she’ll empower communities to overcome pockets of blight and give local businesses a chance to flourish.</li><li>As a young lawyer working for the Children’s Defense Fund, Hillary went to South Carolina to work to stop the incarceration of teenagers in adult prisons, and she investigated school segregation in Alabama at so-called “private academies.”</li><li>In Arkansas, she started a legal aid clinic to ensure that poor people had access to real legal representation; she helped start a program to help low income parents prepare their kids for school success, which is now in more than 20 states; and she helped to found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which helped nearly 40,000 single parents with their education.</li><li>As first lady, she continued her advocacy for children and families, helping to pass the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which now covers more than 8 million kids, helping reform the foster care and adoption system, and advocating for the expansion of Medicaid to cover foster kids until they are 21. She pushed for the expansion of Head Start and for breaking barriers for working parents like quality child care and equal pay for women.</li><li>As a U.S. senator, she worked to improve pre-K programs and provide parenting help for at-risk families, which is now part of the Affordable Care Act, and she pushed to expand CHIP to cover more kids. She co-sponsored legislation to end racial profiling and implement sentencing reforms to address crack-cocaine disparities. She also fought to restore voting rights for individuals involved in the criminal justice system, expand programs that help people re-enter society when they have served their time, and worked to expand assistance for at-risk kids including intervention and treatment. She also introduced comprehensive legislation to protect voting rights; supported increased funding for HIV/AIDS programs, spotlighting the disproportionate impact on African American women; and worked with then Senator Obama to fight against lead poisoning, holding the first hearing on environmental justice and disparate impacts on the African American community.</li></ul> | <ul><li>We must demilitarize our police forces so they don’t look and act like invading armies.</li><li>We must invest in community policing. Only when we get officers into the communities, working within neighborhoods before trouble arises, do we develop the relationships necessary to make our communities safer together. Among other things, that means increasing civilian oversight of police departments.</li><li>We must create a police culture that allows for good officers to report the actions of bad officers without fear of retaliation and allows for a department to follow through on such reports.</li><li>We need police forces that reflect the diversity of our communities, including in the training academies and leadership.</li><li>At the federal level, we need to establish a new model police training program that reorients the way we do law enforcement in this country. With input from a broad segment of the community including activists and leaders from civil rights organizations we will reinvent how we police America.</li><li>We need to federally fund and require body cameras for law enforcement officers to make it easier to hold them accountable.</li><li>We need to require police departments and states to collect data on all police shootings and deaths that take place while in police custody and make that data public.</li><li>We need new rules on the allowable use of force. Police officers need to be trained to de-escalate confrontations and to humanely interact with people who have mental illnesses.</li><li>States and localities that make progress in this area should get more federal justice grant money. Those that do not should get their funding slashed.</li><li>We need to make sure federal resources are there to crack down on the illegal activities of hate groups.</li><li>We need to re-enfranchise the more than two million African-Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction, paid their debt to society, and deserve to have their rights restored.</li><li>Congress must restore the “pre-clearance” formula under the Voting Rights Act, which extended protections to minority voters in states and counties where they were clearly needed.</li><li>We must expand the Act’s scope so that every American, regardless of skin color or national origin, is able to vote freely.</li><li>We need to make Election Day a federal holiday to increase voters’ ability to participate.</li><li>We must make early voting an option for voters who work or study and need the flexibility to vote on evenings or weekends.</li><li>We must make no-fault absentee ballots an option for all Americans.</li><li>We must automatically register every American to vote when they turn 18 or move to a new state. The burden of registering voters should be on the state, not the individual voter.</li><li>We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls.</li><li>We need to make sure that there are sufficient polling places and poll workers to prevent long lines from forming at the polls anywhere.</li><li>We need to ban prisons for profit, which result in an over-incentive to arrest, jail and detain in order to keep prison beds full.</li><li>We need to turn back from the failed “War on Drugs” and eliminate mandatory minimums which result in sentencing disparities between black and white people.</li><li>We need to take marijuana off the federal government’s list of outlawed drugs.</li><li>We need to allow people in states which legalize marijuana to be able to fully participate in the banking system and not be subject to federal prosecution for using pot.</li><li>We need to invest in drug courts and medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that they do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.</li><li>We need to boost investments for programs that help people who have gone to jail rebuild their lives with education and job training.</li><li>We must investigate local governments that are using implicit or explicit quotas for arrests or stops.</li><li>We must stop local governments that are relying on fines, fees or asset forfeitures as a steady source of revenue.</li><li>Police departments must investigate all allegations of wrongdoing, especially those involving the use of force, and prosecute aggressively, if necessary. If departments are unwilling or unable to conduct such investigations, the Department of Justice must step in and handle it for them.</li><li>We need to give our children, regardless of their race or income, a fair shot at attending college. That’s why all public universities should be made tuition free. We should pay for that with a tax on Wall Street speculators.</li><li>We must invest $5.5 billion to create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged young Americans who face high unemployment rates and job-training opportunities for hundreds of thousands of young adults. We should pay for that by ending the loophole allowing Wall Street hedge fund managers to pay a lower tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.</li><li>We must increase the minimum wage to a livable wage of $15 an hour by 2020 —which will increase the wages of about half of African-Americans and nearly 60 percent of Latinos.</li><li>We must invest $1 trillion to put 13 million Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling cities, roads, bridges, public transportation systems, airports, drinking water systems and other infrastructure needs.
