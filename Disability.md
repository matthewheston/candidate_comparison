Here's bullet points extracted on this issue from each candidate:

| Hillary | Bernie |
| ------  | -----  |
|  Realize the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act.   Improve access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities.  Provide tax relief to help the millions of families caring for aging relatives or family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  Hillary’s first job out of law school was with the Children’s Defense Fund, and one of her first tasks was going door to door to figure out why so many children were missing school. She discovered that many parents were not sending their children to school because schools did not accommodate disabilities.  The evidence she helped gather was presented to Congress, and built the case for passage of the law that ensures all children with disabilities have access to school.  As secretary of state, Hillary worked to build strong support for the United States to join the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  But despite a broad, bipartisan coalition, the Republican-controlled Senate blocked its passage.  Now, 25 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Hillary recognizes that there is still much work to do, including improving access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities. Too many Americans with disabilities continue to be left out of the workforce, and for those who are employed, too many are in under-stimulating jobs that don't fully allow them to use their talents. | Protect and expand the Social Security Disability Insurance Program (SSDI)SSDI is vitally important to more than 11 million Americans, including more than one million veterans and nearly two million children. The average disability benefit is about $1,200 a month. For many people, that is their entire income. Increase employment and educational opportunities for persons with disabilities. In the year 2016, it is unacceptable that over 80 percent of adults with disabilities are unemployed. We need to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and vocational education programs. We also need to expand funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), which aim to provide “one-stop shopping” for information on long-term services and support. Fight for the U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Bernie will continue to fight for equal access and equal rights for people with disabilities. That’s why Bernie strongly supports the ratification of this important treaty. |
